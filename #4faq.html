            <div>
                <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the basic language used to create webpages. You use tags like &lt;p&gt; for paragraphs, &lt;a&gt; for links, and &lt;img&gt; for images. It's super simple!</p>

            <summary>How do I make a website?</summary>
            <div>
                <p>To make a website, you'll need to write HTML for the structure, CSS for the styling, and maybe some JavaScript for interactivity. Save your file as .html, open it in a browser, and bam! You've got yourself a website. It might be ugly at first, but hey, that's part of the learning process!</p>

            <summary>What is CSS?</summary>
            <div>
                <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It's what makes your website look pretty. You can change the colors, fonts, and layout using CSS. Without it, everything would look super boring and basic.</p>

            <summary>What is JavaScript?</summary>
            <div>
                <p>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. Want a button to do something when clicked? JavaScript is your guy. It brings your page to life!</p>
